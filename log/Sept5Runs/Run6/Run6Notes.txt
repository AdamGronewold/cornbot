Run 6 Notes:

Date: Sept 5
Boom Height: Gray+Yellow Extended
Distance: 65 paces (approx. 1/4 of the field length)
GPS Data: PySerialClient log files
GoPro Footage on the chest and boom cameras, I think the first few are duds
GPS data appears complete, but the end of the run likely includes many stationary data points
